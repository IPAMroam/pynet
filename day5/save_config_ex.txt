Save Config Ex1
----------------

Use ntc-ansible to save the config of all the Arista, NXOS, and Cisco
IOS devices to ~/CFGS.

Modify your subprocess exercise such that:
1. You check your changes into git
2. You email yourself the changes (git log -p -1)
3. Add the script into cron so that it executes automatically
