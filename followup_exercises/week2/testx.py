so what could I do here. I should integrate operational data and executing show commands.

I could configure BGP using Netmiko

I could configure vlans 821, 822, 823 on all four arista switches.
I could verify that they all exist.
I could assign arista1, Ethernet7 to be a trunk with vlans 821,822,823
